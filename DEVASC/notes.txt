GIT
Branches don't interfere with eachother. Parallel timelines. They all have aliases.
Fast forward merge are when a branch is ahead of master and you merge them onto the master.
3-way-merge merges a branch into the master and retains all changes from both
    git config --global user.email "nicholaspasqualetti@gmail.com"
    git config --global user.name "Nicholas Pasqualetti"
    git add *.*
    git clone https://github.com/npasqualetti/portfolio.git (like git init, you will have an origin, all commits are commited individually)
    git remote -v
    git push origin
    git pull (admin approves the changes)
    git log --oneline
    git branch Test
    git checkout Test
    git merge Test

XML, JSON, YAML Data Formats
Strutured for computers, readable to humans, open and extensable, self describing, platform agnostic
    XML - Extensible markup language 
        uses tags, legacy support, SOAP (web based API protocol to transfer data), verbose and cluttered, higher bandwidth, 
        empty elemnt can be merged into one open/close
        DOM - Document Object Model
            Requires a root tag, prologue is optional, tags can nest, attribute can be ids (double quote the attributes)
    JSON - Javascript Object Notation
        native javascript, popular, lightweight, no need for syntax (can be one line)
    YAML - YAML aint markup language
        lighter weigh then json, legable, compact, need syntax (can't be one line), ideal for configuration
